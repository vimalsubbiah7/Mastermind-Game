Mastermind game on Kotlin
### Mastermind

Mastermind is a board game. The first player invents a code consisting of 4 balls of six different colors and the second player tries to break it. For task simplicity, we'll use letters from A to F instead of colors. Note that the letters might be repeated in the code.

The second player makes consecutive attempts to guess the code: he suggests the new combination of letters on each try until his guess is correct. The first player evaluates each combination by comparing it to her secret, and says how many letters are guessed correctly. First, she says the number of letters which are guessed with their positions, then the number of remaining letters which are guessed right but stay on the wrong positions.
